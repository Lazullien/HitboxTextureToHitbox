THE TOOL HELPS CONVERT PICTURES TO HITBOXES

 * THE HITBOXES IN THE PICTURES NEEDS TO BE CONSEQUTIVE, PIXEL-PERFECT RECTANGLES (NOT FILLED, 1 px BORDER), THEY MUST NOT BE DIRECTLY NEXT TO ANOTHER RECTANGLE WITHOUT BEING AT LEAST ONE PIXEL APART

 * WIDTH AND HEIGHT HAS TO MATCH PIXELS WITHIN AN IMAGE OF EACH FRAME YOU WISH

 * THE RESULTS ON ONE RUN CAN ONLY BE HORIZONTAL, ANIMATIONID DEFINES THE Y AXIS ANIMATION, THIS IS BASED BY FRAME NOT PIXELS

 * THE TOOL IS FORMATTED SO THAT THE HIGHER THE HITBOX, THE GREATER THE Y AXIS IN THE RESULT, IF YOU WISH TO FLIP THIS, REPLACE "height - rect.y - rect.height - defaultY" WITH "rect.y - defaultY"

 * DEFAULT X AND Y REFERS TO THE POSITION WITHIN A FRAME IN THE IMAGE THAT YOU WISH TO BE THE POSITION OF THE ENTITY CASTING THIS HITBOX, THEY CAN BE SET TO 0 IF YOU DON'T WISH THE RESULTS TO BE A RELATIVE POSITION TO THIS ENTITY
 
 * THE RESULTS TOOL IS DIRECTLY COMPATIBLE WITH MY RIENET ENGINE, ALSO FOUND ON GITHUB

 * P.S: If your game has gravity, I do not recommend moving the lowest hitbox up within one animation, the character could fall into the ground
